# Google doesnt allow to map the naked subdomains (http://quoteurl.com)
# only CNAMEs like www. (http://www.quoteurl.com). 
# Since we want http://quoteurl.com/something to work we need to redirect
# all urls to their www.â€¦ equivalent, this is what this rewriting rule do
# it just makes sure the final url will start with www that is a mapped CNAme already
